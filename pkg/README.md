# qrtransfer

## How to Use

![Demo](demo.gif)

1. Open [https://westxu.github.io/qrtransfer/](https://westxu.github.io/qrtransfer/) on your PC, select file, zoom/adjust the browser window as you wish. Note that this site is static, which means the file will be processed natively in your browser and won't be uploaded to any server.
2. Download `receive_pythonista.py` into your iPad/iPhone's pythonista app.
3. Run the `receive_pythonista.py` script in pythonista on your iOS device, scan using your camera while scrolling/auto-scrolling your browser until finish scanning all qrcodes, view/share the received file in pythonista.

## Note

If your browser somehow couldn't access local files, try the [python branch of this repo](https://github.com/WestXu/qrtransfer/tree/python).

The transfer speed is ~0.1KB/s. I know, but it works.
